  /* --- Phone chrome ---
     The system status bar stays visible (no fullscreen). Three adjustments
     make it behave:
     - touch-action: pan-y pinch-zoom kills double-tap-to-zoom (and the 300ms
       tap delay) while keeping vertical pan. Omitting pan-x (i.e. not using
       the manipulation alias) forbids HORIZONTAL pan on the root: a
       left-edge horizontal drag would otherwise be claimed by the browser as
       a pan (firing pointercancel) before the sidebar swipe layer can
       classify it. touch-action does not inherit and the behavior
       intersection stops at the first scroll container, so only touches
       landing directly on the root background are affected — inner
       horizontal scrolling of content containers is untouched. pinch-zoom is
       listed on purpose (#45): a bare pan-y also drops pinch, and then a
       zoom the browser applied by itself — iOS enlarges the viewport when a
       field under 16px takes focus — can no longer be undone by the user,
       so the app stays magnified until it is reopened or rotated. Two-finger
       zoom is also the WCAG 1.4.4 escape hatch and costs the gesture layer
       nothing: pinch is not a horizontal pan.
     - overscroll-behavior-x: none suppresses the browser's edge history
       navigation on the root scroller — Android Chrome claims a horizontal
       stroke that STARTS within its edge band (EDGE_WIDTH_DP=48dp,
       NavigationHandler.java) and navigates BACK, the exact gesture that
       opens the drawer ("页面直接返回上一页", 2026-08-29 user report). Only
       html/body count for this (Chromium issue 41483088: inner containers
       are ignored by the navigation path). iOS Safari's edge back-swipe has
       no CSS opt-out (WebKit bug 240183) — there the widened gesture start
       zone (START_ZONE_RATIO 0.45 of the viewport width, ~176px at 390px,
       past every browser's edge-claim strip) is the mitigation.
     - With the client's viewport-fit=cover, env(safe-area-inset-top) is the
       status bar / notch height; the rules below push the app content below
       it so the status bar never covers anything. Off notched phones (or in
       a normal browser tab where the layout viewport already sits below the
       status bar) the inset is 0 and nothing shifts. */

  /* AppFrame: the drawer takes the sidebar column out of grid flow, so the
     remaining in-flow items (center, details) land in tracks 1..2: give the
     center every pixel and keep the details track at zero. The top padding
     clears the status bar / notch for every in-flow surface (session header,
     messages, composer); the absolutely-positioned drawer is unaffected (its
     containing block is the frame's padding box, i.e. still the frame top).
     box-sizing MUST be border-box: the official frame is height:100% of a
     100%-height body, and it is content-box by default, so the safe-area
     padding is ADDED on top of the full viewport height. The frame then grows
     to 100% + inset, the document itself becomes scrollable by exactly the
     inset, and the sticky composer seat (bottom:0 of the scroll body) lands
     below the visual viewport. Symptoms on a notched phone: the whole UI can
     be swiped up, the composer lifts off the bottom leaving a blank strip,
     and the newest message sits under the composer because the host's
     at-bottom follow scrolls its own scroll body, not the document. With
     border-box the padding is taken out of the 100% height instead, so the
     frame is exactly one viewport tall and the document never scrolls.

     The leading html element selector is load-bearing, not decoration: the
     third-party @linxin666/dsh-web-all sheet ships an equal-specificity
     !important grid-template-columns for this same element under
     (max-width: 768px), so without the extra element the winner is decided by
     which sheet happens to be injected later. Measured before and after with
     scripts/probes/cascade-conflict-probe.mjs: no computed value moves, the
     rule only stops depending on sheet order (audit D-5 option A). */

     Closed state: translateX(-110%) — more than -100% of the max-content
     width — guarantees the whole drawer (and its shadow, had it one) leaves
     the viewport. A mere -100% leaves a sliver on screen; -105% (as used

     A seat registered on conversation.input.model replaces the official pill,

     the pill absorber rule above never matches, and the meter fallback below
     would split the slack with the seat (two auto margins share it), leaving
     the seat stranded mid-lane. Worse, in the seat's open state the root's
     only child is the absolutely positioned panel, so the root collapses to
     zero width and the panel's right:0 anchor (width min(336px, 100vw - 32px))
     sweeps 336px leftward from wherever the stranded root sits — 230px off
     screen at 393px (reporter-measured: root x=106, panel left=-230; with our
     stylesheet disabled the root sat at x=339 and the panel at +3, which pins
     the blame on our injection). Both repairs anchor on the plugin's own
     stable data-seat-* markers (identical across v0.2.3-v0.3.1) and leave the
     official pill untouched:
     1. the seat root stretches across the trailing lane with its content
        pushed to the right edge, so the closed chip welds onto the
        [meter][send] cluster AND the grown root consumes all free space,
        which zeroes the meter fallback's margin-left:auto (flexible lengths
        resolve before auto margins — no double void);
     2. while the panel is open its anchor is re-centered on the stretched
        root (the same left:50% + translateX recipe as the official menu
        rule), so the panel hugs the composer's right side and the plugin's
        own min(336px, 100vw - 32px) width keeps it inside the viewport at
        every width. The reporter's rejected translateX attempt centered on
        the UNFIXED zero-width root; centering only works once the root is

     [role="tab"] { min-height: 44px }, and both rows then grow to 44: the
     title row is floored by the empty utilities seat above, the tab row by the

     1 border, for 36px of painted content. Capping the rows at 36/32 and the
     tabs at their own content height gives 77px, with nothing else degraded —
     title, mode text, status chips, chevrons and both pinned corner buttons
     keep their measured geometry, and the tab strip keeps its #41 contract
     (horizontal scroll, 16px gap, whole labels, pan-x).
     The host's 8px padding-top is deliberately kept: the title row's 28px
     content then centres at y=26, exactly the centre of the pinned corner
     controls (toggle and Files opener both sit at top:12, 28px tall). Trimming
     that padding to 4 shaved 4 more px but left the text row visibly riding

  /* --- Settings dialog on mobile ---
     Desktop: 800px two-column flex (188px nav + content). Mobile: a
     near-full-width sheet — nav tabs wrap into rows on top, option rows
     stay horizontal (title+description left, control right). Structural
     selectors are scoped to the unique aria-modal dialog; every
     settings-specific rule is gated with
     :has(> :first-child > :last-child > button) — the settings nav tab
     list holds <button> tabs, so the transient export dialog (the same
     primitives Modal, header(title+close)+description+body) keeps its
     official centered card layout. Requires :has() support
     (Chromium 105+, 2022).

     The directory picker (dsh-client-ui-directory-picker-browse) must be
     excluded too: its footer bar holds <button> children AND its breadcrumb
     trail (role="navigation") — which the role gate relies on to exclude
     it — is REPLACED by the path input in edit mode (pencil button), so
     without the ZuhsRW exclusion clicking the pencil would suddenly match
     this sheet rule: the dialog jumps to the top of the screen, the header
     (with the path input) is hidden by the > :first-child > :first-child
     display:none rule below, and the user can no longer type a path
     (issue #12, 2026-08-16). The picker family keeps the official layout
     on mobile in every mode.

     The keyboard-shortcut modal (dsh-client-ui-shortcuts, the same
     primitives Modal → data-shortcut-modal="shortcuts") needs the same
     exclusion for the same class of reason: its first child is the
     CONTENT column (nhfO0a_contents = header + search row + list +
     footer), not a nav row, and its footer holds <button> children, so
     the family predicate matched it and the sheet rules transposed the
     whole dialog — measured 2026-09-25 at 390px: the
     > :first-child { flex-direction: row } rule laid search row / list /
     footer SIDE BY SIDE (x=20 / 118 / 278, list 1296px tall, spilling
     far outside the sheet), and > :first-child > :first-child
     { display: none } swallowed the 「快捷键」 title together with its
     close button (owner report). The host tags every modal of this
     family: data-shortcut-modal="settings" on the settings sheet,
     "shortcuts" on this one — gating on that attribute (not on a hashed
     class) keeps the official centered card, the same treatment the

  /* The tab strip stays clear of the toolbar: the toolbar (the close ✕ on
     this host — the config-file button is hidden below) is absolutely
     positioned over the nav row's right end (#105 A' — it stays at its
     React home in the content column; see below). The strip is pinned to
     ONE horizontal scroller: flex-wrap:nowrap + overflow-x:auto.
     2026-09-25, rc.2 portal regression: 0.1.7-rc.1 rendered this sheet in
     place (inside the app frame); rc.2 wraps it in
     createPortal(..., document.body) — diffed rc.1 vs rc.2 bundles, no
     createPortal before — so every [data-mobile-nav="frame"]-scoped
     dialog rule (the frame-era single-row scroller in compat.css among
     them) went dead the moment the overlay became a direct body child.
     What survived was this rule's own flex-wrap:wrap, which had been
     losing to the host's nowrap scroller and now had nothing to lose to:
     the cells broke into uneven rows (3/2/3/2/1 at 402px) whose first row
     slid under the 138px toolbar (config-file button + close) — the
     settings-sheet half of the owner's 2026-09-25 report. Pinning the
     scroller here makes the geometry host-generation independent again;
     the cells keep flex-shrink:0 + nowrap (rule below), the strip
     scrolls, and the hairline scrollbar is the affordance. The scroller
     VIEWPORT stops short of the toolbar zone: margin-right = toolbar
     width (36: the 32px round close + 4px) + 6px gap (measured
     2026-09-24) reproduces the reparent-era scroller geometry (its box

  /* Content toolbar (close, plus the config-file button on hosts that
     render one): pinned over the nav row's right end, flush right.
     #105 A' — the toolbar stays at its React home (the content column's
     direct child) and is absolutely positioned against the dialog; the
     dialog is position:absolute itself, so it is the containing block
     and no new one is introduced. Constants measured 2026-09-24 (CDP,
     393px): the reparented toolbar — whose visual this replaces — sat
     at in-dialog dy=10 / fromRight=12, hence top 10px / right 12px.
     Out of flow, the toolbar's own row disappears and the options area
     starts right under the nav row; the navList's scroll viewport stops
     short of the toolbar with margin-right = toolbar width (36: the 32px
     round close + 4px) + 6px gap (measured). Children carry official
     auto-margins
     that would defeat flex-end, so neutralize them. The close button
     gets a round tappable base so it reads as its own control, not
     part of the outline button.
     Anchored structurally, not by class substring: a bare [class*="_header"]
     also matches every plugin settings card header in the options area —
     the official Plugins config cards (YyYd_a_header) and the dsh-web-ui-all
     group cards (Kwoi6G_header / Jh0q7G_header / rUBhvW_header; the bpnj3G_/jmhvDG_
     siblings were renamed upstream in dsh-web-all 0.3.20, verified 2026-09-18), all sharing the upstream template text-align:left,
     gap:12px, padding:14px 16px). The old broad anchor right-aligned their
     text, gutted the padding and painted a 32px gray circle behind the
     chevron (2026-09-05 sweep: 8 bleeding headers). The toolbar's one
     structural home is the content column's direct child (the panel's
     :last-child); the post-reparent nav-row home died with the
     settings-toolbar-reparent task. Card headers live deeper — inside
     the options scroll area — and match neither, so no per-plugin hash
     guards are needed. */

     - 详情页（DetailTop 组件）：宿主返回键「返回插件列表」crumb，文字实测
       [24,28,70,19]，同样压在 FAB 左半——点它会触发开抽屉而不是返回。
       详情根的 data-* 标记有三种：内置插件详情 data-plugin-item-detail、市场
       插件详情 data-plugin-row-detail、builtin 详情 data-plugin-detail
       （实测「智能体团队」卡走的就是第三种），三条选择器并列全覆盖。
     让位量 = FAB 右缘（10 + 38 = 48）+ 8px 间距 = 56px，**写成相对量**：
     减掉宿主自己的 padding（clamp(24px,4vw,48px)），这样它跟着视口走，而不是
     把 390px 上量到的 32px 钉死（768px 平板上宿主 padding 是 30.7px，钉死的
     32px 会过量）。在 390px 上它算出来正好还是 32px，与上一版行为一致。
     锚点全部是宿主 data-* 标记，比 css-module 哈希类（X_2TxG_）稳定；

     于是上面三条「> button:first-child」在详情页全部 matches()=false ——
     crumb 的 margin-left 计算值 0px，停在宿主 padding 上：盒 [24,28,342,14]、

       · enter — the panel slides in from the right;
       · exit  — the panel does NOT animate out; the conversation it hands the
         main area back to fades in instead.
     The asymmetry is deliberate. selectPanel(null) remounts the whole
     conversation and that commit blocks the main thread long enough to matter
     (measured on a phone: ~390 ms for a long session), so fading the panel out
     first would leave the screen blank for that whole window — panel already
     transparent, conversation not mounted yet. Keeping the panel opaque until
     the commit means the two swap on one frame.
     The enter rule is a CSS condition on purpose: :has() matches in the same
     commit that swaps the main slot, so the animation is already running at the
     element's first style resolution and there is no full-opacity frame first.
     The exit marker is set by JS before the swap for the same reason. */
