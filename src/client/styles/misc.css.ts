     above the composer. The dock container itself is display:contents

     needs an order change: -1 puts it before the todo card (order 0) and
     before the input card (order 0, later in DOM). The todo card must KEEP
     its order 0 — raising it past the input card's order 0 would drop it

  /* ---------- mattskills status capsule: keep its tail (skills button / fold

      dsh-mattpocock-skills-deck renders a capsule status bar in
      conversation.input.dock (order 40, the row above the composer card). Its
      own sheet deliberately never shrinks icons or counters ("图标与普通计数
      永不收缩"), so as soon as the capsule's content is wider than the pill the
      host wrapper's overflow:hidden cuts the right edge and the two segments
      that sit last — the skills-list button (2×2 grid) and the fold chevron
      that collapses the whole deck strip — are not painted at all.
      Measured 2026-10-10 on a 393px portrait viewport, session bound to a
      ticket with two-digit counters (可接 21 / 诊断 20): capsule content
      ≈ 415px against a ~360px pill, i.e. ~55px short — exactly those two
      segments; the same session on landscape shows both, so this is width
      pressure, not a missing feature (and not a deck version difference:
      1.7.51 / 1.8.0-rc.1 / 1.8.0-rc.2 all render both unconditionally).
      Reclaim the width from the capsule's desktop-sized spacing (6px column
      gap plus 7px padding on each of ~11 children) rather than hiding any
      segment, and keep a horizontal scroll as the fallback for the narrowest
      phones so the tail can still be swiped into view. The scrollbar stays
      hidden, so the pill still reads as one pill. Desktop untouched: this

  /* ---------- ask question composer (ask_user_question): kill iOS Safari
      input-focus auto-zoom ----------
      Safari on iPhone enlarges the whole viewport when a focused <input> /
      <textarea> computes font-size < 16px, and only reverts on blur. The ask
      dialog is a modal composer takeover, so taps outside never blur the
      field and the magnification persists until the field loses focus
      (e.g. the dialog is dismissed). The ask
      composer's custom-answer <input> (.customInput) and optionless free-form
      <textarea> (.customTextarea) both ship at 14px (ui-user-questions
      QuestionComposer.module.css). Raise them to 16px on iOS only, where the
      zoom can actually happen: on Android and desktop there is nothing to
      suppress, so they keep the compact size they were designed with
      (2026-09-16, audit D-1 option A; the iOS WebKit floor below covers these
      fields too, this rule keeps the requirement stated where it applies).
      Scoped to the ask
      composer's stable [data-question-key] root (AGENTS.md: scope hashed-class
      selectors to the owning region, prefer stable data-* markers); the
      class-name suffix match follows the plugin's established harness

  /* ---------- iOS WebKit: hold every text field at >=16px so Safari never
      focus-zooms the viewport (#45) ----------
      Report (iPhone 15 Pro Max): the page magnifies as soon as a field takes
      focus, sometimes also when switching sessions (the host composer mounts
      with autoFocus), and it stays magnified until the app is closed and
      reopened or rotated landscape->portrait.
      Mechanism: iOS Safari enlarges the visual viewport whenever a focused
      input / textarea computes below 16px, and it only zooms back out on
      blur — a chat shell keeps the composer focused, so the zoom has no
      moment to revert; before this fix the root touch-action also withheld
      pinch-zoom, so the user could not pull it back out either (see
      layout.css.ts). maximum-scale=1 in the viewport meta is NOT the fix:
      iOS 10+ ignores it for user pinch zoom while other engines honor it, so
      writing it would only take zoom away from Android. Raising the fields is
      the fix that stays inside the standard.
      Gated on html[data-mobile-nav-ios] (phone-chrome.ts detectIosWebKit)
      because only WebKit on iOS zooms on focus: Android and desktop keep the
      compact 13px search boxes they were designed with. The floor covers
      every text-entry field on the page, including the ones portalled
      outside the frame (settings dialogs, the market sheet, third-party
      panels) — a phone can reach all of them. Button-like and widget inputs
      are excluded (nothing to type, no keyboard), and select is left alone on
      purpose: it would break the composer's 28px access-mode control, and a
      native picker overlays the screen instead of leaving a zoomed page
      behind. The composer's mirror / backdrop layers ride along with the
      textarea: they measure the autosize height and paint the highlight, so
      all three must share one font-size or the caret drifts off the text
      (they inherit 16px from the host card today — the rule locks that in on
      hosts whose composer ships smaller).
      The contenteditable branch is the forward-looking one: dsh
      0.1.2-rc.1 replaces the composer textarea with a Lexical
      contenteditable whose card reads font-size:
      var(--dsh-content-font-size, 14px), i.e. 14px by default — squarely in
      the zoom-triggering range. Match the attribute rather than the value
      "true" (Lexical writes "true", other hosts use plaintext-only or the
      bare attribute) and exclude contenteditable="false", which Lexical puts
      on decorator nodes inside the editor. */

  /* ---------- drawer session tree: skip off-screen rendering ----------
     The drawer mounts ~389 nodes at once (the open gesture early-commits

     visible. content-visibility: auto lets the engine skip layout and

     Report (Android): long-press a word in an AI reply, drag the selection
     handle up over the session header, and the selection jumps to "select
     all" instead of extending through the message list. Mechanism: the
     header and the composer card are ordinary selectable boxes; the header
     sits BEFORE the scrollport in DOM order (header, then
     [data-conversation-scroll]) and the drawer earlier still (frame first
     child, parked off-screen at -110%). A selection extent whose hit point
     resolves into that chrome lands IN the chrome, so the highlighted range
     covers the header and app shell on top of the messages - on a phone it
     reads as the whole page. With the chrome unselectable the extent snaps
     to the nearest message text instead (headless drag-select 390x844
     touch-emulated, message -> header: focus node went from the header
     title span to a message <p>; message -> composer row: from the Send
     button to a message <p>; the scrollport kept auto-scrolling in both).
     Layout is untouched: this only sets user-select.
     Kept selectable: the message flow (outside every rule below) and the
     composer editing surface, which is re-enabled explicitly - auto would
     inherit none from the card, and an unselectable contenteditable cannot
     host a caret or a paste on WebKit. Dialogs and text fields portalled
     into the drawer DOM (settings sheet) are re-enabled the same way, so
     their values stay copyable. Scope: the conversation header is the
     header inside the [data-phase] root (chat content never renders one
     there), and the anchor stays the DESCENDANT form on purpose: 0.2.0-rc.2
     (live-host probe 2026-10-07) renders an unclassed wrapper <div> between
     .wSkVaW_root[data-phase] and <header class="wSkVaW_header">, so the
     child-combinator form this rule used to carry matched 0 elements - the
     title bar kept user-select:auto and a drag-select up over it still ended
     in the header title span (4391 selected chars, opening with the title /
     mode / tab labels). On the composer side only the input card
     ([data-composer-card], host marker since 0.1.2) and the plugin stats
     row - the dock above the card (todo card, approval / ask-question
     panels) is reply content and stays copyable. */
